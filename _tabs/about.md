### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is TuÃ¢n, currently, I am on the way to becoming a Data Engineer. I have a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data from [PSL University](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/wp/iasd/en/). 


### ðŸš€ Technical stack:

- Python, Java, C/C++, Swift
- Apache Spark, Kafka, Cassandra
- GCP: Pub/Sub, DataFlow, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, DataPlex.
- Terraform, Bash Script, Ansible
- GitLab CI
- Monitoring: Grafana, Dashboard: Looker Studio
- Docker
- Linux

## ðŸ’ª Personal projects:

I am spending some time on the following projects:

- [IoT automobile](https://github.com/batuan/project_iot_automobile): My first data pipeline for IoT connected device. In this project, I monitor data from automobile, and save the data to Big database. I have 2 solutions: GCP and Open-Source. You can check my source code (almost bash script and terraform)
- [MLOps zoomcampt](https://github.com/batuan/mlops-zoomcamp): An bootcamp from [Datatalk club](https://datatalks.club/), in this boot camp I will learn how to deploy an end-to-end Machine Learning model. I will update homework and project regularly.
- TIAD: a NLP contest that I participated in 2021.

## ðŸ“– Books:

The books that I am reading:
- Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Book by Joe Reis and Matt Housley)
- Spark: The Definitive Guide: Big Data Processing Made Simple (Book by Matei Zaharia)
- Data Engineering with Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Lakehouse: Create Scalable Pipelines that Ingest, Curate, and Aggregate Complex Data in a Timely and Secure Way (Book by Manoj Kukreja)
